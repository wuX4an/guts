## About:
This framework is a semi-fullstack framework made for Go. I created it with the intention of eliminating the need to create one file at a time. The reason why it uses modules downloaded from the CDN in the front-end and uses SQLite is because I don't want to bloat it unnecessarily, also because I want to keep it as simple as possible and easy to understand at first glance.

### Features:
- Straightforward installation.
- Ease of handling the frontend with the backend.
- Direct and concise examples.
- Ease of scaling.

### Requirements:
- [Golang](go.dev) installed.

### Get started:
```shell
git clone -b start --depth 1 https://github.com/wux4an/guts <Name of your proyect>
```


### Roadmap
- I want to make a cli tool that downloads the tools from the respective CDN'S, also does other things like build in release mode etc.
